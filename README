#
# How to use the code.
#
# 1. All the important stuff happens in the Ruler class. It takes an square image block (this should be
#    a single channel, e.g. grayscale). This block should be chosen to contain part of a ruler in the image. 
# 2. The angle of the ruler, the spacing of the graduations and the relative offset or phase of the graduations
#    are estimated. For must purposes, only the spacing is important as this allows for the image to be
#    calibrated. The spacing is returned in pixels.
# 3. By default, the smallest ruler spacing is given, but the 'which' parameter to the Ruler.wavelength() method
#    can be changed to 1, 2, ... to return multiple spacings. Usually these are just multiple of the smallest.
# 4. The Ruler.orientation() method should be called first, then the Ruler.wavelength() and then Ruler.phase()
#
# 5. The helper functions hp_filter() and extract_block() can be used to pre-process the input (HP filter it), and 
#    extract a suitable block from the input.
# 
# For more information on why the code does what it does, see our paper. Note that *not* all the refimements 
# presented in the published work are implemented in the below. Interesting intermediate results are stored in
# instance members and can be easily plotted, e.g. self.corr, self.spatial, self.csdf, self.sine_rotated, etc.
#
# 6. Interactive version. A simple interactive (OpenCV/mathplotlib.pyplot) driver for the class is provided with
#    this distribution: 
#    
#    Usage: 
#        $ python ruler-interactive.py <image-filename>
# 
#    Once running, you can click on a point in the display window and that should extract an image block and
#    show the results in the plots window. You can use the fast-keys, [], to increase/decrease the block size 
#    (these are trapped by the figure_on_press method).
#    To exit, you need to close the figure window first, then any key will exit the program.  OpenCV windows and matplotlib windows don't play well
#    together, unfortunately.
#
# Possible improvements to the ruler estimation:
#
# The ruler offset (phase) is sensitive to the wavelength estimate, so a local search around the approximation 
# would be beneficial, e.g. a simplex search using a MSE cost (input v. synthesized sine grating model). The ruler 
# orientation may be found incorrectly as it use the principal axis of the amp spectrum. If the ruler edge 'energy' 
# dominates the chosen block window, the angle will be 90 degrees out! 
# It is possible to differentiate the two but this requires looking at the line spectra more closely.
