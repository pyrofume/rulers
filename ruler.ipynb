    "# How to use the code.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. All the important stuff happens in the Ruler class. It takes an square image block (this should be\n",
    "#    a single channel, e.g. grayscale). This block should be chosen to contain part of a ruler in the image. \n",
    "# 2. The angle of the ruler, the spacing of the graduations and the relative offset or phase of the graduations\n",
    "#    are estimated. For must purposes, only the spacing is important as this allows for the image to be\n",
    "#    calibrated. The spacing is returned in pixels.\n",
    "# 3. By default, the smallest ruler spacing is given, but the 'which' parameter to the Ruler.wavelength() method\n",
    "#    can be changed to 1, 2, ... to return multiple spacings. Usually these are just multiple of the smallest.\n",
    "# 4. The Ruler.orientation() method should be called first, then the Ruler.wavelength() and then Ruler.phase()\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. The helper functions hp_filter() and extract_block() can be used to pre-process the input (HP filter it), and \n",
    "#    extract a suitable block from the input.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For more information on why the code does what it does, see our paper. Note that *not* all the refimements \n",
    "# presented in the published work are implemented in the below. Interesting intermediate results are stored in\n",
    "# instance members and can be easily plotted, e.g. self.corr, self.spatial, self.csdf, self.sine_rotated, etc.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. Interactive version. A simple interactive (OpenCV/mathplotlib.pyplot) driver for the class is provided with\n",
    "#    this distribution: \n",
    "#    \n",
    "#    Usage: \n",
    "#        $ python ruler-interactive.py <image-filename>\n",
    "# \n",
    "#    Once running, you can click on a point in the display window and that should extract an image block and\n",
    "#    show the results in the plots window. You can use the fast-keys, [], to increase/decrease the block size \n",
    "#    (these are trapped by the figure_on_press method).\n",
    "#    To exit, you need to close the figure window first, then any key will exit the program.  OpenCV windows and matplotlib windows don't play well\n",
    "#    together, unfortunately.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Possible improvements to the ruler estimation:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The ruler offset (phase) is sensitive to the wavelength estimate, so a local search around the approximation \n",
    "# would be beneficial, e.g. a simplex search using a MSE cost (input v. synthesized sine grating model). The ruler \n",
    "# orientation may be found incorrectly as it use the principal axis of the amp spectrum. If the ruler edge 'energy' \n",
    "# dominates the chosen block window, the angle will be 90 degrees out! \n",
    "# It is possible to differentiate the two but this requires looking at the line spectra more closely.\n",
